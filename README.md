# Hierarchical-Arc-Merging
The title of our paper is "A Community Detection Algorithm Using Network Topologies and Rule-based Hierarchical Arc-Merging (HAM) Strategies".

# Introduction
In this paper, we will apply rule-based strategies to community detection tasks and offer alternative strategies for identifying network community structures. We will also describe our proposal for a simple hierarchical arc-merging (HAM) algorithm that includes a measure for computing the similarities (weights) of adjacent nodes connected by an edge, and for ranking edges based on these weights. There are at least five advantages of using a rule-based HAM algorithm: strategies are easy to implement because they mainly use if-else code statements; rule structures (e.g., for edge merging) are explicit; rule-based programs are efficient because they only need to check rule-defined situations; HAM algorithms have higher community detection resolution; and they can extended for node-based methods.
